## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The information panel shows the selected system

The information panel SHALL be hidden while nothing is selected, and SHALL open on the
selection. It SHALL hold, in this order:

1. A header with the system's name, a copy button beside the name, and a close button.
2. A grid of fields: the position in game coordinates with a copy button, the distance
   from Sol, the range
   from the camera, and then `primaryStar`, `allegiance`, `government`, `primaryEconomy`,
   `security`, `population` and `bodyCount`. A field the record does not carry SHALL be
   left out, not shown empty.
3. The categories, as one chip per category in the record's colour, the primary first and
   then the secondary ones in the order the record gave them.
4. The description, when the record carries one.
5. The images, when the record carries any.
6. A footer with a **centre view** button and one button per entry of the `actions` option.

The field grid SHALL hold **two columns**, as the mockup draws it, and the position field
SHALL carry the mockup's label `POSITION`. An odd count of fields leaves the last field
alone on its row, and that field SHALL take both columns, so the grid shows no empty cell.

**The position SHALL NOT be rounded to a whole light year.** Each of the three game
coordinates SHALL be shown to at most **3 decimal places**, with the trailing zeros dropped
and a thousands separator on the whole part. A coordinate that is a whole number SHALL show
no decimal point.

The game resolves a position to 1/32 of a light year, which is 0.03125. Three decimal places
do not reproduce that value, which needs five, but they **separate** every position the game
can give: the step is 0.03125 and the rounding is 0.001, so no two game positions round to
the same three decimal places. The record carries the value the host's dump gave, in
`float64`, and the panel SHALL show that value and not the whole number it rounds to.

`DISTANCE FROM SOL` and `RANGE` SHALL NOT change. They are distances the user reads to judge
a journey, not the identity of a place, and a whole light year is the right resolution for
them.

The **range from the camera** follows the view, so the panel SHALL rewrite it at most 10
times a second, by the same rule as the top bar. Every other field changes only with the
selection.

**Centre view** SHALL move the view's cursor to the system and SHALL keep the distance,
the yaw and the pitch. The selection itself already centres the system and caps the
distance at 500 light years, which `system-selection` states, so this button is what brings
a system back after the user has flown away from it, and it keeps the zoom they moved to,
however far out that is.

The close button SHALL clear the selection.

**The copy buttons.** The name's button SHALL write the system's name to the clipboard.
The position's button SHALL write the three game coordinates as
`x / y / z`, each with the same digits the field shows and no thousands separator, so what
is copied can be pasted into a field that takes a number. The panel keeps showing the
position with its thousands separators: the separator is for reading and the copy is for
pasting.

A button that has just written SHALL show a tick for **1.4 seconds** and then show its
copy mark again. Only one button SHALL show a tick at a time. A click on one while the
other shows a tick SHALL move the tick.

Each button SHALL carry an accessible name: `Copy system name` and `Copy position` while
idle, and `Copied` while the tick shows.

The clipboard is not always there: a browser may refuse the write, and a page served over
plain HTTP has no `navigator.clipboard`. A refused write SHALL NOT throw out of the HUD and
SHALL NOT stop the frame loop. The button SHALL show no tick when the write failed.

A click on a copy button SHALL NOT clear or change the selection.

An `actions` entry SHALL draw as a button with its `label`, and a click SHALL call its
`onSelect` with the selected system. The library SHALL NOT read what `onSelect` returns and
SHALL NOT let a failure in it stop the frame loop.

#### Scenario: The panel opens on a selection and shows the record

- **WHEN** the browser test adds a record with a name, coordinates, an allegiance, a
  population and a description but no `primaryStar`, selects it, and reads the panel
- **THEN** the panel is shown, the header holds the name, the grid holds the position, the
  distance from Sol, the range from the camera, the allegiance and the population, there
  is no primary star field, and the description is shown

#### Scenario: The position keeps its fraction

- **WHEN** the browser test selects a record at `x = -9530.9375`, `y = -910.28125` and
  `z = 19808.125`, and reads the position field
- **THEN** it reads `-9,530.938 / -910.281 / 19,808.125`

#### Scenario: A whole coordinate shows no decimal point

- **WHEN** the browser test selects a record at `x = 100`, `y = 0` and `z = -25.5`, and
  reads the position field
- **THEN** it reads `100 / 0 / -25.5`

#### Scenario: The distance fields stay whole

- **WHEN** the browser test selects the record of the scenario above and reads
  `DISTANCE FROM SOL` and `RANGE`
- **THEN** both hold a whole number of light years and the unit `LY`, and neither holds a
  decimal point.

  The record sits 103 light years from Sol and the selection holds the camera within 500,
  so neither field passes 1,000 and neither shows a thousands separator. The separator is
  what the scenario "The position keeps its fraction" reads, in `-9,530.938`

#### Scenario: An odd count of fields leaves no empty cell

- **WHEN** the browser test selects a record that gives three fields and reads the box of
  the last field and the box of the grid
- **THEN** the last field is as wide as the grid, and the earlier two are each about half
  of it

#### Scenario: A record with no description hides that section

- **WHEN** the browser test selects a record that carries no `description` and no `images`
- **THEN** the panel holds no description section and no images section

#### Scenario: Centre view moves the cursor alone

- **WHEN** the browser test selects a system 400 light years from the cursor, reads the
  view, clicks **centre view** and reads the view again
- **THEN** the cursor is the system's position and the distance, the yaw and the pitch are
  unchanged

#### Scenario: Centre view keeps the distance at a close zoom

- **WHEN** the browser test selects a system, zooms out to 4,000 light years, moves the
  cursor 800 light years away, clicks **centre view** and reads the view
- **THEN** the cursor is the system's position and the distance is still 4,000

#### Scenario: The close button clears the selection

- **WHEN** the browser test selects a system, clicks the close button, and reads
  `getSelection`
- **THEN** the reading is null and the panel is hidden

#### Scenario: A host action gets the selected system

- **WHEN** a browser test builds a map with one `actions` entry, selects a system and
  clicks that button
- **THEN** `onSelect` was called once with the selected system

#### Scenario: A failing host action does not stop the map

- **WHEN** a browser test builds a map with an `actions` entry whose `onSelect` throws,
  selects a system, clicks the button, and then draws 10 frames
- **THEN** the frames draw and the map still answers `getView`

#### Scenario: The name button copies the name

- **WHEN** the browser test selects a system, grants the clipboard permission, clicks the
  copy button beside the name, and reads the clipboard
- **THEN** the clipboard holds the system's name and the selection is unchanged

#### Scenario: The position button copies three whole numbers

- **WHEN** the browser test selects a system at (1235, -20, 25895), clicks the copy button
  in the position field, and reads the clipboard
- **THEN** the clipboard reads `1235 / -20 / 25895`, and the field beside it reads
  `1,235 / -20 / 25,895`

#### Scenario: The position button copies a fraction

- **WHEN** the browser test selects a system at (1234.5, -20, 25895), clicks the copy button
  in the position field, and reads the clipboard
- **THEN** the clipboard reads `1234.5 / -20 / 25895`

#### Scenario: The tick shows and goes

- **WHEN** the browser test clicks the name's copy button, reads the button at once, waits
  1.6 seconds and reads it again
- **THEN** the first reading shows the tick and an accessible name of `Copied`, and the
  second shows the copy mark and an accessible name of `Copy system name`

#### Scenario: Only one tick at a time

- **WHEN** the browser test clicks the name's copy button and then the position's within
  1.4 seconds, and reads both
- **THEN** only the position's button shows a tick

#### Scenario: A refused write does not break the panel

- **WHEN** the browser test replaces the clipboard write with one that rejects, selects a
  system, clicks both copy buttons, and then draws 10 frames
- **THEN** neither button shows a tick, the panel still shows the record, and the frames
  draw
