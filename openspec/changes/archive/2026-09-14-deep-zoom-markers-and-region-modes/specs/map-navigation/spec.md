## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Zoom with limits
Each wheel notch SHALL multiply the distance by 1.15 (toward the cursor for a forward
notch). Distance SHALL be clamped to 10 to 120,000 light years.

The close limit is 10 light years because that is the edge of a mass-code `a` boxel, the
finest cell the game's own hierarchy holds, and because a marker's drawn size caps at 12
CSS pixels. Below 10 light years no marker grows, no line gains detail and no new source
of light appears, so a closer limit only spreads the same markers further apart.

#### Scenario: Zoom in
- **WHEN** a unit test applies one forward notch at distance 20,000
- **THEN** the distance is 17,391 within 1 light year

#### Scenario: Limits
- **WHEN** a unit test applies 100 forward notches from 20,000 light years and 100
  backward notches from 20,000 light years
- **THEN** the first gives 10 and the second gives 120,000

#### Scenario: The close limit takes more notches than the old one
- **WHEN** a unit test applies forward notches from 120,000 light years one at a time and
  counts how many it takes to reach the limit
- **THEN** the count is 68, which is 28 more than the 40 notches that reached 500 light
  years, so the wheel keeps its 1.15 step and the range alone is wider

#### Scenario: A stored fragment still loads
- **WHEN** the page loads with `#c=0,0,0&d=2000&p=35&y=0`, a view written before the
  limit moved
- **THEN** the distance is 2,000, because the limit only widened the range

#### Scenario: A fragment below the old limit now loads
- **WHEN** the page loads with `#c=0,0,0&d=50&p=35&y=0`
- **THEN** the distance is 50, and with `d=1` it is 10

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The near plane follows the zoom distance

The near plane of the perspective projection SHALL be `min(10, distance / 10)` light
years, where `distance` is the zoom distance. It SHALL therefore be 10 light years at
every zoom distance of 100 light years and above, which is every zoom distance the map
could reach before this change, and no view that draws today SHALL draw differently.

The rule exists because the cursor sits exactly `distance` light years from the camera. A
fixed near plane of 10 light years puts the cursor on the near plane at a zoom distance
of 10 and in front of it below that, so the point the user is looking at would be clipped
away. With the rule the cursor sits at ten times the near plane at every zoom distance.

No pass reads the depth buffer, so the near plane changes clipping alone and no depth
resolution figure depends on it.

#### Scenario: The near plane at each zoom distance

- **WHEN** a unit test reads the near plane at zoom distances 10, 50, 100, 500, 20,000 and
  120,000 light years
- **THEN** the readings are 1, 5, 10, 10, 10 and 10 light years

#### Scenario: The cursor is never clipped

- **WHEN** a unit test projects the cursor at every zoom distance from 10 to 120,000 light
  years, stepping by the wheel's 1.15 factor, at a pitch of 5 and of 89 degrees
- **THEN** the cursor projects in front of the near plane at every step, and to the centre
  of the screen within 1 pixel

#### Scenario: A marker at the cursor draws at the closest zoom

- **WHEN** the browser test adds one category and one system at Sol, opens
  `#c=0,0,0&d=10&p=35&y=0`, and reads the middle pixel of the marker
- **THEN** the pixel holds the marker's colour, so the near plane did not clip it

#### Scenario: The near plane changes no view that draws today

- **WHEN** the browser test renders the default view and the view
  `#c=0,0,0&d=500&p=35&y=0` with the new near plane rule
- **THEN** each image file is byte-identical to the same view rendered with a fixed near
  plane of 10 light years
