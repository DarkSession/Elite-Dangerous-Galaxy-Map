## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The map is created through a library entry point

The map SHALL expose `createGalaxyMap(canvas, options)`. The call SHALL return a handle
in the same tick, before the scene data is ready. `options` SHALL be optional, and SHALL
carry an optional `labelHost` element for the region label overlay, an optional
`regionMode`, which `galactic-regions` defines, an optional `grid`, which
`coordinate-grid` defines, and an optional `hud`, which `map-hud` defines. With no `labelHost`
the library SHALL create its own overlay element in the canvas's parent, so a host that
gives a canvas alone gets a working map. The library SHALL NOT read an element by id.

The handle SHALL carry these members:

| Member                        | What it does                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `addCategories(categories)`   | Reads categories into the table and returns the report        |
| `addSystems(records)`         | Reads records into the set and returns the report             |
| `clearSystems()`              | Empties the set                                               |
| `clearSystemsAndCategories()` | Empties the set and the category table                        |
| `systemCount()`               | How many systems the set holds                                |
| `ready`                       | A promise that settles when the map starts, or fails          |
| `dispose()`                   | Stops the map and releases what it holds                      |
| `getView()`                   | Reads the current view                                        |
| `setView(view)`               | Replaces part or all of the current view                      |
| `onViewChange(fn)`            | Calls `fn` after the view changes, and returns an unsubscribe |
| `getRegionMode()`             | Reads the region overlay mode                                 |
| `setRegionMode(mode)`         | Replaces the region overlay mode                              |
| `getSystem(index)`            | Reads one system of the set, or null outside it               |
| `categoryCount()`             | How many categories the table holds                           |
| `getCategory(index)`          | Reads one category of the table, or null outside it           |
| `setCategoryVisible(name, on)`| Turns the markers of a category on or off                     |
| `isCategoryVisible(name)`     | Reads whether the markers of a category draw                  |
| `setNameFilter(text)`         | Keeps the markers whose name holds the text                   |
| `getNameFilter()`             | Reads the filter text                                         |
| `getSelection()`              | Reads the selected system, or null                            |
| `setSelection(identity)`      | Selects a system by its identity, or clears the selection     |
| `onSelectionChange(fn)`       | Calls `fn` after the selection changes, returns an unsubscribe |
| `getHover()`                  | Reads the hovered system, or null                             |
| `systemAt(x, y)`              | The system under a canvas pixel, or null                      |
| `setSystemNamesVisible(on)`   | Turns the marker name labels on or off                        |
| `areSystemNamesVisible()`     | Reads whether the marker name labels draw                     |
| `setGridVisible(on)`          | Turns the coordinate grid on or off                           |
| `isGridVisible()`             | Reads whether the coordinate grid draws                       |
| `regionNameAt(point)`         | The region name at a point on the galactic plane, or null     |
| `hud`                         | The HUD handle, null when the option is off or before `ready` |
| `debug`                       | The renderer hooks the browser tests read                     |

`ready` SHALL resolve after the map draws its first frame. `addCategories`, `addSystems`,
`clearSystems` and `clearSystemsAndCategories` SHALL work before and after that frame, and
a system added before the first frame SHALL draw in it.

The library SHALL own the render context, the scene data, the view state, the controls,
the label overlay, the selection state, the HUD when the option asks for it, and the
frame loop. The library SHALL NOT read or write
`window.location`, and an ESLint rule SHALL fail the lint on `window.location` in every
source file outside `src/app/main.ts`. A lint rule is what holds the boundary, because
the production build puts the page and the library in one bundle, where a search of the
served source cannot tell them apart. The project already holds its scene-data import
rule this way.

The page owns the URL fragment: it parses the fragment, gives the view to `setView`, and
writes the fragment back from `onViewChange`. The requirement "View state in the URL
fragment" of `map-navigation` is then the page's to meet, and it is unchanged.

`debug` is not part of the supported surface. It carries the pass switches, the pixel
readers, the frame measurement, the counts and the program probe.

`getSystem` and `getCategory` read the set one entry at a time and return a copy. The set
holds at most 10,000 systems, so a host that lists them walks the indices, and the handle
never builds an array of 10,000 records for one call.

`debug` SHALL carry `setCloseFade(value)`, which holds the close fade of
`close-view-stars` at the given number from 0 to 1, and `setCloseFade(null)`, which gives
it back to the zoom distance. The close fade empties the invented field at the zoom
distances where the field's own look constants were measured, so the browser tests that
pin the field's light and its grain hold the fade at 1 and read the frame the constants
were fitted to. The override is a test hook and nothing in the page or the controls
reaches it.

`debug` SHALL carry `frameStats()`, which returns the number of frames the loop drew
since the last reset with their mean and worst draw time in milliseconds, and
`resetFrameStats()`, which starts the count again. The existing `measureFrames` redraws
one fixed view and returns a mean, so it cannot measure a pan, a zoom or a worst frame;
`frameStats` measures the frames the loop itself draws, as `labelSampling` already does
for the label sweep. `frameStats` times the draw call alone, because the frame budget
requirement of `far-view-rendering` forbids a wait for the card in the normal loop, so
its numbers are not on the same scale as `measureFrames`.

`debug` SHALL carry `setNearPlane(value)`, which holds the near plane at the given number
of light years, and `setNearPlane(null)`, which gives it back to the zoom distance rule.
The scenario "The near plane changes no view that draws today" of `map-navigation` reads a
frame drawn against the fixed near plane of 10 light years the map used before the rule
existed, and no frame the map draws by itself can give that reading. The override is a
test hook, as `setCloseFade` is, and nothing in the page or the controls reaches it.

The demo page SHALL call the entry point, SHALL put the handle on `window.galaxyMap`,
and SHALL keep every `window.__galaxyMap` hook the browser tests read today, including
`renderer`, which carries the hardware assertion.

`getRegionMode` and `setRegionMode` are on the handle and not on `debug`, because the
region mode is a setting a host chooses and not a renderer probe. The `regions` pass
switch stays on `debug`.

#### Scenario: The region mode is on the handle and not on debug

- **WHEN** a browser test reads `getRegionMode` and `setRegionMode` on the handle and on
  `debug`
- **THEN** both are functions on the handle, and neither is on `debug`

#### Scenario: The handle works before the first frame

- **WHEN** the browser test opens the page, reads `window.galaxyMap` before `ready`
  resolves, adds one system at Sol, then waits for `ready`
- **THEN** `systemCount` is 1 before the wait, and the first frame the page draws holds
  a marker at Sol's pixel

#### Scenario: The handle empties the set

- **WHEN** a browser test adds 100 systems, reads `systemCount`, calls `clearSystems`
  and reads it again
- **THEN** the first reading is 100 and the second is 0

#### Scenario: The handle empties the set and the table together

- **WHEN** a browser test adds 2 categories and 100 systems, calls
  `clearSystemsAndCategories`, reads `systemCount`, then adds one record that names a
  category of the table it just emptied, and then adds that category and the same record
  again
- **THEN** the reading is 0, the first record is rejected as `unknown-category`, and the
  second is added

#### Scenario: The page writes the fragment from the handle

- **WHEN** the browser test calls `setView` on the handle with a new cursor and waits for
  the page to write the fragment
- **THEN** the fragment holds the new cursor

#### Scenario: The lint holds the library away from the location

- **WHEN** `pnpm lint` runs over the tree, and again over a tree where
  `src/app/create-map.ts` reads `window.location.hash`
- **THEN** the first run is clean and the second fails on that line

#### Scenario: The library makes its own label host

- **WHEN** a browser test calls the entry point with a canvas whose parent holds no
  element with the id `labels`, and with no `options`, and waits for `ready`
- **THEN** the map draws and the region labels show

  The test reaches the entry point through `window.galaxyMapFactory`, which the demo page
  sets beside `window.galaxyMap`. The browser suite runs against the built preview, which
  serves no source path the test could import.

#### Scenario: The handle reads the set one entry at a time

- **WHEN** a unit test adds two categories and three systems, then reads `systemCount`,
  `getSystem(0)`, `getSystem(2)`, `getSystem(3)`, `categoryCount()`, `getCategory(0)` and
  `getCategory(2)`
- **THEN** the count is 3, the first two reads give the first and the third record,
  `getSystem(3)` gives null, the category count is 2, `getCategory(0)` gives the first
  category and `getCategory(2)` gives null

#### Scenario: A handle built with no HUD option carries no HUD

- **WHEN** a browser test calls the entry point with no `options`, waits for `ready`, and
  reads `hud`
- **THEN** the reading is null and the canvas's parent holds no HUD element

### Requirement: A record follows the shape of an EDSM or a Spansh dump

A record SHALL carry a `name` that is a string of at least one character, a `coords`
object whose `x`, `y` and `z` are finite numbers, and a `primaryCategory` that is the name
of a category the table holds. The position is in game coordinates in light years.

A record MAY carry `secondaryCategories`, an array of names of categories the table
holds. The array MAY hold any number of names. The reader SHALL drop a name that repeats
and a name equal to the primary category, and SHALL keep the rest in the order the record
gave them. A `secondaryCategories` that is present and is not an array SHALL be dropped,
as an optional field of the wrong type is dropped. An entry of the array that is not the
name of a category the table holds SHALL reject the record, which covers an entry that is
not a string. A secondary category does not change how a marker draws; phase 4 reads it
in the HUD.

The reader SHALL keep these optional fields when they are present and of the stated
type, and SHALL drop every other field of the record:

| Field             | Type                       |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- |
| `id64`            | number, string or `bigint` |
| `allegiance`      | string                     |
| `government`      | string                     |
| `primaryEconomy`  | string                     |
| `security`        | string                     |
| `population`      | finite number              |
| `bodyCount`       | finite number              |
| `description`     | string                     |
| `primaryStar`     | string                     |
| `images`          | array, read as below       |

The reader SHALL store `id64` as a decimal string. A Spansh `id64` is a 64-bit integer,
and `JSON.parse` loses digits above 2^53, so a host that needs every digit passes a
string or a `bigint`.

`description` is a paragraph about the system and `primaryStar` is the class of its
primary star, for example `K5 V`. Neither changes how a marker draws. The HUD shows each
one and hides its section when the record carries none.

`images` is an array of entries, each an object with a `url` string and an optional
`caption` string. The reader SHALL keep at most **8** entries, in the order the record
gave them, and SHALL drop the rest. The reader SHALL drop an entry that is not an object,
an entry whose `url` is not a string, an entry whose `url` is empty, and an entry whose
`url` names a scheme that is not `http` or `https`. A `url` with no scheme is a relative URL and SHALL be kept. A bad entry
SHALL NOT reject the record, because an image is decoration and the rest of the record
still draws and still reads.

The scheme rule is a safety rule, not a formatting one. The HUD puts the `url` in an image
element, so a `javascript:` or a `data:` URL from an untrusted dump would run or embed
content the host did not mean to serve. The library SHALL NOT fetch an image itself: the
browser loads it from the element.

#### Scenario: An EDSM record and a Spansh record are both read

- **WHEN** a unit test adds two categories, then one EDSM record, which carries `id64`,
  `name`, `coords`, `primaryCategory` and `date`, and one Spansh record, which carries
  those fields and `allegiance`, `government`, `primaryEconomy`, `security`,
  `population`, `bodyCount`, `bodies` and `stations`
- **THEN** both are accepted, the kept fields hold the values the records gave, and
  neither `date` nor `bodies` nor `stations` is held

#### Scenario: An unknown secondary category rejects the record

- **WHEN** a unit test adds the category `A`, then two records that name `A` as the
  primary category: one whose `secondaryCategories` hold `B`, which the table does not
  hold, and one whose `secondaryCategories` is the string `A` and not an array
- **THEN** the first is rejected as `unknown-category`, and the second is accepted with
  no secondary category

#### Scenario: The secondary categories are kept in order, without a repeat

- **WHEN** a unit test adds the categories `A`, `B` and `C`, then one record whose
  primary category is `A` and whose `secondaryCategories` are `C`, `B`, `C` and `A`
- **THEN** the record is accepted and holds the secondary categories `C` and `B`, in that
  order

#### Scenario: A large id64 keeps every digit

- **WHEN** a unit test adds a record whose `id64` is the string `2871051900826` and one
  whose `id64` is the bigint `18262930337633`
- **THEN** the reader holds `"2871051900826"` and `"18262930337633"`

#### Scenario: The three HUD fields are kept when they are strings

- **WHEN** a unit test adds one category, then one record that carries `description`,
  `primaryStar` and `images` of one entry, and one record whose `description` is the
  number 4 and whose `primaryStar` is null
- **THEN** both records are accepted, the first holds all three, and the second holds
  neither string

#### Scenario: The image list drops a bad entry and caps at eight

- **WHEN** a unit test adds one record whose `images` hold, in order, an entry with the
  `url` `https://example.test/a.png` and the caption `A`, an entry with the `url`
  `javascript:alert(1)`, an entry with the `url` `/local/b.png`, an entry that is the
  string `c.png`, and then 10 more entries with valid `https` URLs
- **THEN** the record is accepted and holds 8 images: the `https` entry with its caption,
  the relative entry, and the first 6 of the 10, and neither the `javascript` entry nor
  the string entry is held

#### Scenario: An images field that is not an array is dropped

- **WHEN** a unit test adds one record whose `images` is the string `a.png` and one whose
  `images` is an empty array
- **THEN** both records are accepted and neither holds an image

### Requirement: A marker draws for every system at every zoom distance

The renderer SHALL draw one marker per system in the set, in one draw call, at every
zoom distance from 10 to 120,000 light years, for every system the range rule below keeps,
whose primary category is on, and whose name the filter keeps. There SHALL be no level of
detail: the pass draws the whole set in every frame.

A marker's size SHALL follow one rule for both styles. The **disc diameter** in CSS pixels
is `focalCss * 20 / range`, held between a floor of 7 and a cap of 12, where `range` is
the distance from the camera in light years and `focalCss` is the CSS pixels per light
year at one light year of range. The renderer's own `focal` is in device pixels, because
it comes from the drawing buffer height, so `focalCss` is `focal` over the device pixel
ratio and `gl_PointSize` is the CSS diameter times that ratio. The floor is what makes a
marker findable in the far view, where the perspective size falls below one pixel. The cap
stops a near marker from covering the frame. A `glow` marker's sprite SHALL be **2.5 times
the disc diameter**, so the two styles grow together and stop together and one set of
constants sets both.

The pass SHALL hold the size it asks for at or below the card's maximum point size, which
`ALIASED_POINT_SIZE_RANGE` reports. A 30 CSS pixel glow at a device pixel ratio of 3 asks
for 90 device pixels, which is the largest sprite the map draws, so a card that reports
less must cap rather than let the driver decide.

A marker SHALL take the colour of its category as the category stands when the frame
draws. A category replaced under the same name SHALL therefore recolour every marker that
names it, and the set SHALL NOT copy the colour into the record.

The core colour SHALL NOT follow the population zone ramp that the decoration stars and
the point cloud use. Two systems of one primary category SHALL draw one colour, wherever
they lie, and two systems of different categories SHALL draw the two colours the
categories give. The category colour is the first of the two things that separate a real
system from an invented star. The second is the close fade of `close-view-stars`, which
holds the invented field at no light below a zoom distance of 640 light years while a
marker draws at every zoom distance.

The page SHALL expose the number of markers the last frame drew, which is the number the
range rule, the category visibility and the name filter kept together, and not the number
the set holds.

#### Scenario: A marker shows at every zoom distance

- **WHEN** the browser test adds one category with `maxDrawRange` 200,000, adds one system
  at (0, 0, 6,000), then opens the view `#c=0,0,6000&d=10&p=35&y=0` and the same cursor at
  500, 4,000, 20,000 and 120,000 light years, and reads the pixel at the projection of the
  system with the pass on and with it off
- **THEN** the two readings differ at every one of the five distances. The category takes a
  range above the default so that the 120,000 light year view reads the zoom limit and not
  the range limit

#### Scenario: The marker colours reach the frame over both grounds

- **WHEN** the browser test adds one category of the colour (153, 230, 255) and the
  `markerStyle` `disc`, then one system at the galactic centre, which is the brightest
  ground, and one 3,000 light years above the plane at the rim, which is the darkest,
  opens a view that shows each at a range above 3,000 light years, and reads the middle
  pixel of each marker and, on the row through its centre, the ring pixel whose own centre
  lies between 1 and 2 CSS pixels inside the edge of the disc, at a device pixel ratio of 1
- **THEN** every middle pixel is (153, 230, 255) within 2 per channel, and every ring
  pixel is (5, 10, 26) within 2 per channel

#### Scenario: The size falls to the floor and rises to the cap

- **WHEN** the browser test adds one category of the `markerStyle` `disc` and the
  `maxDrawRange` 200,000 and one system, opens a view at 120,000 light years and counts
  the pixels of the row through the marker's centre that differ from the frame drawn with
  the pass off, then opens a view that puts the system 500 light years from the camera and
  counts again
- **THEN** the first count is 7 within 1 and the second is 12 within 1, at a device pixel
  ratio of 1. The tolerance is one pixel, because a disc that does not sit on a pixel
  centre covers one more or one fewer pixel on its row. The category takes a range above
  the default because the system sits at the cursor, so at a zoom of 120,000 light years
  its camera range is 120,000 exactly, on the boundary of the default cut

#### Scenario: The page reports the marker count

- **WHEN** the browser test reads the marker count with an empty set, adds 100 systems
  around Sol at a view that shows them all, draws a frame and reads the count again, then
  switches the systems pass off, draws again and reads it a third time
- **THEN** the readings are 0, 100 and 0

#### Scenario: The colour follows the category and not the position

- **WHEN** the browser test adds one category, then one system at Sol and one at the
  galactic centre, whose population zones differ, and reads the middle pixel of each
  marker at the same range; then adds a second category of another colour, replaces the
  record at Sol with one that names it, and reads the two pixels again
- **THEN** the first two pixels hold the same colour, and the second two hold the colour
  of each system's own category

#### Scenario: A recoloured category recolours its markers

- **WHEN** the browser test adds one category of the colour (153, 230, 255) and one
  system, reads the middle pixel of the marker, then adds a category of the same name and
  the colour (255, 40, 40), draws a frame and reads the pixel again
- **THEN** the first reading is (153, 230, 255) and the second is (255, 40, 40), each
  within 2 per channel, and the system count does not change

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A category can be turned off

The handle SHALL carry `setCategoryVisible(name, visible)` and `isCategoryVisible(name)`.
A category SHALL be on when the table takes it, so a host that never calls the setter sees
the map it sees today.

A marker whose primary category is off SHALL NOT draw and SHALL NOT be picked. The rule
reads the **primary** category alone, which is the category the marker takes its colour
from. A secondary category does not bring a marker back.

A call that names a category the table does not hold SHALL change nothing and SHALL NOT
throw. `isCategoryVisible` SHALL return `false` for such a name.

A category replaced under the same name SHALL keep the visibility it had, because the
replacement changes the table entry and not what the user chose to look at.
`clearSystemsAndCategories` SHALL clear the visibility with the table.

The change SHALL reach the next frame with no rebuild of the scene data and no reupload of
the system positions.

#### Scenario: A category that is off draws no marker

- **WHEN** the browser test adds two categories and one system in each, at a view that
  shows both, reads the marker count, calls `setCategoryVisible` with the first category
  and `false`, draws a frame and reads the count and the pixel at each marker again
- **THEN** the first count is 2 and the second is 1, the pixel of the first marker matches
  the frame drawn with the systems pass off, and the pixel of the second does not

#### Scenario: A hidden category is not picked

- **WHEN** the browser test adds one category and one system, turns the category off,
  draws a frame, and calls `systemAt` at the pixel the system projects to
- **THEN** the reading is null

#### Scenario: A replaced category keeps its visibility

- **WHEN** a unit test adds a category, turns it off, adds a category of the same name
  and another colour, and reads `isCategoryVisible`
- **THEN** the reading is `false`

#### Scenario: An unknown name changes nothing

- **WHEN** a unit test calls `setCategoryVisible('nothing', false)` on a map whose table
  holds one other category, then reads `isCategoryVisible('nothing')` and
  `isCategoryVisible` of the category it does hold
- **THEN** the call does not throw, the first reading is `false` and the second is `true`

### Requirement: A name filter hides the markers that do not match

The handle SHALL carry `setNameFilter(text)` and `getNameFilter()`. The filter SHALL be
empty when the map starts, and an empty filter SHALL keep every marker.

A marker SHALL draw only when its system's name holds the filter text, compared without
case. The comparison SHALL fold case with the same rule in every browser, which is a lower
case fold of both strings. A marker the filter drops SHALL NOT be picked.

`setNameFilter` SHALL walk the set once and SHALL NOT rebuild the scene data. The set
holds at most 10,000 names, so one call is one pass over at most 10,000 strings. The HUD
calls it at most once per 150 ms while the user types, which `map-hud` states.

`clearSystems` SHALL NOT clear the filter, because the filter is what the user asked to
see and not part of the data.

#### Scenario: The filter cuts the markers and the count

- **WHEN** the browser test adds one category and three systems named `Sol`, `Solati` and
  `Achenar` at a view that shows all three, reads the marker count, calls
  `setNameFilter('sol')`, draws a frame and reads the count, then calls
  `setNameFilter('')`, draws and reads again
- **THEN** the three readings are 3, 2 and 3

#### Scenario: The filter folds case

- **WHEN** a unit test adds a system named `Achenar` and calls `setNameFilter` with
  `ACHE`, then `ache`, then `AcHe`
- **THEN** the system is kept by all three

#### Scenario: A filtered marker is not picked

- **WHEN** the browser test adds one system named `Sol`, draws a frame, calls `systemAt`
  at the pixel it projects to, sets the filter to `zzz`, draws again and calls `systemAt`
  at the same pixel
- **THEN** the first reading names `Sol` and the second is null
