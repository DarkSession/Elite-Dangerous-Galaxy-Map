# Third-party notices

This package uses data, art and code from other projects. This file names each source
and its terms. Read it before you redistribute the package or use it for money.

The map is a non-commercial fan project. Some of the terms below are non-commercial, so
a commercial use of the package needs new permission from each holder.

**This file covers what the package ships.** The repository holds a demo site, a test
suite and a design mockup beside the package, and their sources have terms of their own.
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` at the root of the
[repository](https://github.com/DarkSession/Elite-Dangerous-Galaxy-Map) names those.
Each source is in one file alone. The Frontier terms are the one statement in both,
because the package ships game art and the demo site draws game data.

## `@elite-dangerous-almanac/core`

The map depends on [`@elite-dangerous-almanac/core`](https://github.com/DarkSession/Elite-Dangerous-Almanac),
pinned to an exact version. The map reads four leaves of it: `astro/galaxy-grid` and
`astro/mass-code` for the sector and boxel geometry, and `astro/codex-region` and
`astro/codex-region-lookup` for the galactic codex regions.

The almanac package's own code is under the **MIT** licence, copyright 2026 Elite
Dangerous Community. Its data keeps the terms of its own sources, and it carries its
full notices in its own published package.

## EliteDangerousRegionMap

The 42 galactic codex regions, their ids and their lookup geometry come from
[EliteDangerousRegionMap](https://github.com/klightspeed/EliteDangerousRegionMap) by Ben
Peddell (klightspeed), under the **MIT** licence. The almanac package carries the
region tables; this map reads them through it.

## Elite Dangerous game data and visuals (Frontier Developments)

The galaxy this map draws is the game's galaxy. The data the package reads and the art
it draws are the property of **Frontier Developments plc**.

The map uses them under Frontier's
[media-usage rules](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/elite-dangerous-media-usage-rules.510879/),
which permit non-commercial use only. The package's own code is under the MIT licence,
which `LICENSE.md` states, and those terms do not reach the game data and the art: this
project cannot license what it does not own. A commercial use of them needs new
permission from Frontier.

> This map was created using assets and imagery from Elite Dangerous, with the
> permission of Frontier Developments plc, for non-commercial purposes. It is not
> endorsed by nor reflects the views or opinions of Frontier Developments and no
> employee of Frontier Developments was involved in the making of it.

## The HUD fonts

The HUD bundles two font families. The build carries the `woff2` files from the two
packages, so no host page reaches a font CDN and the browser tests stay offline.

- **Chakra Petch**, from [`@fontsource/chakra-petch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fontsource/chakra-petch).
  Copyright 2018 The Chakra Petch Project Authors, under the **SIL Open Font License,
  Version 1.1**.
- **IBM Plex Mono**, from [`@fontsource/ibm-plex-mono`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fontsource/ibm-plex-mono).
  Copyright 2017 IBM Corp, under the **SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1**.

The licence permits use, study, change and redistribution, on these conditions: the
font files keep this notice, a changed font takes another name, and a font is not sold
by itself. Each package carries the full licence text in its own `LICENSE` file. The
full text is also at <https://openfontlicense.org/>.

## The selection pin

`packages/galaxy-map/src/app/markers.ts` draws a pin over the selected system. The shape is the system
marker of the game's own galaxy map. The eight points of the path come from
`https://edassets.org/static/img/galaxy-map/Marker-galaxy-map.svg`, which ED Assets
publishes. This project commits no copy of that file: the eight numbers are written
into a path of its own.

ED Assets states no licence on the file. This notice records where the numbers came
from. The shape itself is Frontier Developments' and falls under the same
non-commercial media usage rules as the game data above.

## The procedural naming tables

`astro/galaxy-grid` also reaches the almanac's procedural naming tables, which come
from EDTS by Andy Martin under the BSD 3-Clause licence. Those terms need the licence
text in full wherever the tables travel. The build drops the tables from the bundle:
the map reads two constants from that leaf and calls no naming function, so
tree-shaking removes them. A check after `pnpm build` confirms it. If a later build
carries the tables, add the BSD 3-Clause text here.
